This is the code for our proposed method, SymbolicGPT. We tried to keep the implementation as simple and clean as possible to make sure it's understandable and easy to reuse. Please feel free to add features and submit a pull-request.

# Mirror Repository:
If you want to pull, open an issue or follow this repository, you can use this github repo [link](https://github.com/mojivalipour/symbolicgpt) which is a mirror repo for this one. Unfortunately, the UWaterloo GITLAB is limited to users with @uwaterloo emails. Therefore, you cannot contribute to this repository. Why do I not use github directly? You can find the answer [here](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us). It's because I no longer trust GITHUB as my primary repository. Once, I was adversely affected for no good reason.

# Abstract:
Symbolic regression is the task of identifying a mathematical expression that best fits a provided dataset of input and output values. Due to the richness of the space of mathematical expressions, symbolic regression is generally a challenging problem. While conventional approaches based on genetic evolution algorithms have been used for decades, deep learning-based methods are relatively new and an active research area. In this work, we present SymbolicGPT, a novel transformer-based language model for symbolic regression. This model exploits the advantages of probabilistic language models like GPT, including strength in performance and flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our model performs strongly compared to competing models with respect to the accuracy, running time, and data efficiency.

# Setup the environment
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/)
- Create the environment from environment.yml, as an alternative we also provided the requirements.txt (using Conda)
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
- As an alternative you can install the following packages:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install torch
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install tqdm
```

# Dataset Generation

You can skip this step if you already downloaded the datasets using this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yq03daorth1h4kj/AADolbgySCjOO18qGoP5Abqfa?dl=0).

## How to generate the training data:
- Use the corresponding config file (config.txt) for each experiment
- Copy all the settings in config file into dataset.py
- Change the seed to 2021 in the dataset.py 
- Change the seed to 2021 in the generateData.py 
- Generate the data using the following command:
```bash
$ python dataset.py
```
- Move the generated data (./Datasets/\*.json) into the corresponding experiment directory (./datasets/{Experiment Name}/Train/\*.json)

## Generate the validation data:
- Use the corresponding config file (config.txt) for each experiment
- Copy all the settings in config file into dataset.py except the numSamples
- Make sure that the numSamples = 1000 // len(numVars) in the datasetTest.py 
- Change the seed to 2022 in the datasetTest.py 
- Change the seed to 2022 in the generateData.py 
- Generate the data using the following command:
```bash
$ python datasetTest.py
```
- Move the generated data (./Datasets/\*.json) into the corresponding experiment directory (./datasets/{Experiment Name}/Val/\*.json)

## Generate the test data:
- Use the corresponding config file (config.txt) for each experiment
- Copy all the settings in config file into dataset.py except the numSamples
- Make sure that the numSamples = 1000 // len(numVars) in the datasetTest.py 
- Change the seed to 2023 in the datasetTest.py 
- Change the seed to 2023 in the generateData.py 
- Generate the data using the following command:
```bash
$ python datasetTest.py
```
- Move the generated data (./Datasets/\*.json) into the corresponding experiment directory (./datasets/{Experiment Name}/Test/\*.json)

# Train/Test the model

It's easy to train a new model and reproduce the results.

## Configure the parameters

Follow each dataset config file and change the corresponding parameters (numVars, numPoints etc.) in the symbolicGPT.py script. 

## Reproduce the experiments
